The goal of this article is to add some extra info
about blog writing with _Jekyll_.

## Structure your posts

Use level 2 (`##`) and if necessary level 3 (`###`) titles
to structure your posts.

## Display code snippets

*You can display a block of code `like` the following using triple backticks.
You can also specify the language after the first triple backticks.*

```python
def hello(name):
    return f'hello {name}'
```
```c#
public static ShaderParametricComponent GetShaderParameters(string shaderName) => Shader.Find(shaderName).parametricComponent;
```
